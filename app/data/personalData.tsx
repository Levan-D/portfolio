              As a React Developer at COTT, London, since August 2022, I have undertaken a
              wide array of responsibilities. I have designed and implemented UI elements
              using the React Redux Toolkit, and have been instrumental in refactoring
              existing React projects for better performance and maintainability. One of
              my notable achievements was the complete rewriting and architecture overhaul
              of a key software product which involved intricate state management, use of
              Ant Design UI library, and integration of numerous API endpoints.

              Additionally, I have been at the forefront of testing and evaluating
              potential technologies, frameworks, and projects that can be adopted by the
              company to drive innovation. I also designed a mobile version of an
              Innovative Hospitality IPTV Platform, aligning with the company&apos;s goal
              to expand its product reach and user experience. My role not only involves
              development but also requires me to work under the direction of Senior
              Software Developers, ensuring the successful implementation and regular
              updates of application modules.

            My key responsibilities included developing an internal web application to
            parse and sort a sizable database. Initially, I built a mechanism for
            automatic database parsing, integrating Firebase for real-time data handling
            capabilities. In the subsequent phase, I designed and implemented a dynamic
            user interface to facilitate manual data sorting operations, enabling users to
            continue the sorting process as per their specific requirements. This project
            required in-depth understanding of database structures and proficient
            application of front-end technologies to ensure seamless interaction and data
            handling.
